# 🎮 LikuBuddy Extension

**Your AI-powered generative game platform and terminal companion, living right inside your CLI.**

LikuBuddy is a sophisticated Terminal User Interface (TUI) extension for the Gemini CLI. It transforms your terminal into an **AI-Elicited, Database-Backed Generative Game Platform** where you can:

- 🛠️ **Build games** by describing them in natural language
- 🎮 **Play games** - both built-in classics and AI-generated creations
- 📊 **Track progress** with persistent SQLite database
- ❤️ **Care for Liku** - your AI companion with real needs
- 🌟 **Share experiences** through the community games library

Built with **React**, **Ink**, **SQLite**, and **Gemini AI**, it offers a complete game development and playing experience directly in your terminal.

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ AI-Powered Game Builder
**NEW!** Create games by simply describing them:
*   Tell LikuBuddy what kind of game you want
*   Choose detailed mode (with AI questions) or quick mode (instant generation)
*   AI generates complete, working game code using the Liku SDK
*   Games are automatically installed and ready to play
*   All community games stored in SQLite and accessible from the menu

### 🎮 Play & Earn
Play classic arcade games to earn **XP** and increase Liku's **Happiness**. But watch out—playing costs **Energy**!

*   **❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe**: Challenge Liku to a duel. The AI adapts to your difficulty setting!
*   **🦖 Dino Run**: A side-scrolling physics runner. Jump over cacti and dodge flying bats in a living world.

### ❤️ Buddy System
Liku isn't just a menu; he has needs!
*   **Hunger**: Feed Liku using XP you've earned from games.
*   **Energy**: Liku gets tired after playing. Let him **Rest** to recover.
*   **Happiness**: Winning games makes Liku happy. Losing might make him sad (but he's a good sport).
*   **Leveling**: Earn XP to level up your profile.

### 🌟 Community Games
*   Browse AI-generated games created by you or others
*   Play any community game directly from the menu
*   All games follow the Liku SDK contract for consistent quality
*   Leaderboards track high scores across all games

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone & Build**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TayDa64/LikuBuddy.git
    cd LikuBuddy
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Set up Gemini API Key** (for game generation):
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    # OR
    export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    Get your free API key from: https://ai.google.dev/

3.  **Install into Gemini CLI**:
    ```bash
    gemini extensions install .
    ```

4.  **Launch**:
    You can launch LikuBuddy in two ways:
    
    **Option A: Via Gemini CLI Slash Command**
    ```bash
    /liku
    ```

    **Option B: Directly from Terminal**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR if installed globally
    liku
    ```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Playing Built-in Games
1. Launch LikuBuddy: `/liku`
2. Select "🎮 Let's Play"
3. Choose Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, or Dino Run
4. Play and earn XP!

### Creating Your First Game
1. Launch LikuBuddy: `/liku`
2. Select "🛠️ Build a Game (AI-Powered)"
3. Describe your game: *"A puzzle where I match colors"*
4. Choose Quick Mode for instant generation
5. Wait 10-30 seconds for AI to generate your game
6. Play your new game from "🌟 Community Games"!

### Viewing Stats

- Monitoring Liku's stats while working on other tasks
- Reducing screen clutter when you don't need the full menu

## 🤖 AI Agent Interaction

If you are an AI agent (like Gemini) trying to play the game, you can use the provided PowerShell scripts to send keyboard commands to the running game window.

1.  **Start the game** in a separate terminal window:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2.  **Use the helper scripts** to control the game:
    *   `.\down.ps1` - Press Down Arrow
    *   `.\up.ps1` - Press Up Arrow
    *   `.\left.ps1` - Press Left Arrow
    *   `.\right.ps1` - Press Right Arrow
    *   `.\enter.ps1` - Press Enter
    *   `.\feed.ps1` - Feed Liku (Shortcut 'f')
    *   `.\rest.ps1` - Rest Liku (Shortcut 'r')

    *Note: These scripts attempt to automatically find the game window (looking for "Liku" or "node"). If they fail, you can pass the Process ID explicitly: `.\down.ps1 -Id 1234`*

3.  **Read the Game State**:
    The game writes its current state (screen name, stats, menu items) to a file named `likubuddy-state.txt` in the root directory.
    **ALWAYS read this file** before deciding which key to press. It tells you what is currently selected and if Liku needs attention (e.g., feeding or resting).

    Example `likubuddy-state.txt` content:
    ```text
    CURRENT SCREEN: Main Menu
    STATS: Level: 11, XP: 106, Hunger: 90%, Energy: 15%, Happiness: 80%
    MESSAGE: Liku is too tired to play! Let him rest first.
    MENU ITEMS:
      [ ] 🎮 Let's Play
      [ ] 🔨 Let's Build a Game!
      [ ] 🌟 Community Games
      [ ] 💻 LikuOS Stats
      [ ] 🍖 Feed Liku (XP -10, Hunger -20)
      [ ] 💤 Rest (Energy +30, Hunger +10)
      [ ] ⚙️ Settings
      [x] 🚪 Exit
    ```
