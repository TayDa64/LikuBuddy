# 🎮 LikuBuddy Extension

**Your AI-powered generative game platform and terminal companion, living right inside your CLI.**

LikuBuddy is a sophisticated Terminal User Interface (TUI) extension for the Gemini CLI. It transforms your terminal into an **AI-Elicited, Database-Backed Generative Game Platform** where you can:

- 🛠️ **Build games** by describing them in natural language
- 🎮 **Play games** - both built-in classics and AI-generated creations
- 📊 **Track progress** with persistent SQLite database
- ❤️ **Care for Liku** - your AI companion with real needs
- 🌟 **Share experiences** through the community games library

Built with **React**, **Ink**, **SQLite**, and **Gemini AI**, it offers a complete game development and playing experience directly in your terminal.

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ AI-Powered Game Builder
**NEW!** Create games by simply describing them:
*   Tell LikuBuddy what kind of game you want
*   Choose detailed mode (with AI questions) or quick mode (instant generation)
*   AI generates complete, working game code using the Liku SDK
*   Games are automatically installed and ready to play
*   All community games stored in SQLite and accessible from the menu

**Example**: "Make a space shooter where I dodge asteroids" → Complete game in 30 seconds!

### 🕹️ The Game Hub
A central dashboard to manage your activities. Check Liku's stats, launch games, adjust settings, or build new games.

### 🎮 Play & Earn
Play classic arcade games to earn **XP** and increase Liku's **Happiness**. But watch out—playing costs **Energy**!

*   **❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe**: Challenge Liku to a duel. The AI adapts to your difficulty setting!
*   **🦖 Dino Run**: A side-scrolling physics runner. Jump over cacti and dodge flying bats in a living world.

### ❤️ Buddy System
Liku isn't just a menu; he has needs!
*   **Hunger**: Feed Liku using XP you've earned from games.
*   **Energy**: Liku gets tired after playing. Let him **Rest** to recover.

## 🎮 Game SDK

Want to create games manually? Follow the Liku SDK contract:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Box, Text, useInput } from 'ink';

interface GameProps {
  onExit: () => void;
  difficulty?: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}

const MyGame = ({ onExit, difficulty }: GameProps) => {
  useInput((input, key) => {
    if (key.escape) onExit();
    // Your game logic
  });

  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column" borderStyle="round" borderColor="cyan">
      <Text bold>My Awesome Game</Text>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default MyGame;
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### `/liku` command not recognized
If the `/liku` command isn't working:

1. **Verify installation completed successfully**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.gemini/commands/liku.toml
   ```
   This file should exist and contain the path to your LikuBuddy installation.

2. **Check that the build completed**:
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/index.js
   ```
   If this file doesn't exist, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Reinstall the command**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/install-command.js
   ```

### Missing menu items (Build a Game, LikuOS Stats)
If you don't see all menu items after installation:

1. **Ensure you have the latest version**:
   ```bash
   git pull
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify the UI files are compiled**:
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/ui/BuilderUI.js dist/ui/LikuOS.js
   ```

3. **Try running directly**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   You should see all 8 menu items including "🛠️ Build a Game (AI-Powered)" and "💻 LikuOS Stats".

### Database errors
If you encounter database errors:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.gemini-liku/snake.db
npm start  # Will recreate database with default values
```
